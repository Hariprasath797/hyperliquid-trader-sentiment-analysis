# Trader Performance vs Market Sentiment — Summary

## Methodology
Trader execution data was aggregated at a daily trader level and aligned with
daily market sentiment (Fear/Greed). Key performance and behavioral metrics
such as daily PnL, win rate, trade frequency, position size, and directional
bias were computed. Performance and behavior were then compared across
sentiment regimes, and traders were segmented into behavioral groups.

## Insights
1. Traders experience lower profitability and higher downside risk during
   Fear regimes.
2. Greed regimes are associated with increased trading activity and larger
   position sizes.
3. Consistent traders are less sensitive to sentiment-driven volatility,
   while frequent and inconsistent traders are more negatively impacted
   during Fear periods.

## Strategy Recommendations
- During Fear regimes, reduce trade frequency and position sizes to control
  drawdowns, especially for high-frequency traders.
- During Greed regimes, allow increased activity only for traders with
  demonstrated consistency and strong historical win rates.
