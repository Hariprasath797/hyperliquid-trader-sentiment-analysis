# Trader Performance vs Market Sentiment — Summary

## Methodology
This analysis combines daily market sentiment data from the Fear & Greed Index
with trader-level execution data from Hyperliquid. Trading activity was
aggregated at a daily trader level and aligned with corresponding market
sentiment regimes. Key performance and behavioral metrics—including daily PnL,
win rate, trade frequency, average trade size, and directional bias—were
engineered to assess how trader behavior and outcomes vary across Fear and
Greed conditions. Traders were further segmented based on activity levels and
performance consistency to identify heterogeneous responses to sentiment
shifts.

## Key Insights
1. **Performance Degradation During Fear Regimes**  
   Trader profitability declines during Fear periods, accompanied by a higher
   proportion of losing days, indicating increased downside risk and elevated
   market uncertainty.

2. **Risk-On Behavior During Greed Regimes**  
   Greed periods are characterized by higher trading activity and larger
   position sizes, suggesting increased risk appetite and momentum-driven
   behavior.

3. **Heterogeneous Impact Across Trader Types**  
   Consistent traders exhibit greater resilience to sentiment-driven volatility,
   while high-frequency and inconsistent traders are disproportionately
   impacted during Fear regimes.

## Strategy Recommendations
- **Risk Control in Fear Regimes**  
  During Fear periods, limit trade frequency and reduce position sizes,
  particularly for high-frequency or historically inconsistent traders, to
  mitigate drawdowns.

- **Selective Risk-Taking in Greed Regimes**  
  During Greed periods, allow increased trading activity and exposure only for
  traders with demonstrated consistency and strong historical win rates, while
  maintaining strict controls for others.
